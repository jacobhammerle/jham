            <p class="lato-light text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">My name is Jacob Hammerle. I am currently a software engineer at <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="https://www.cerkl.com" target="_blank">Cerkl</a> based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Throughout my professional career I have worked at <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Softbank Robotics</a> in San Francisco, <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="https://www.geaviation.com/" target="_blank">GE Aviation</a>, and <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="https://www.brandery.org/" target="_blank">The Brandery</a>.</p>

            <p class="lato-light text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">I graduated from Miami University where I studied Interactive Media Studies and Entrepreneurship. During my time in school I worked on a lot of small side projects, but my most significant project came out of my senior thesis. During my last semester in college I developed the minimal viable product of what later became <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="http://www.tryminute.com/" target="_blank">Minute</a>. Minute is a journal that calls you. The primary objective of the app is to eliminate friction and help you jumpstart the healthy habit of journaling.</p>

            <p class="lato-light text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">Now I am currently working on my latest side project...my take on note taking</p>

            <p class="lato-light text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">To get in touch, please send an email to <a class="lato-regular hover:underline" href="mailto:jacobhammerle@gmail.com">jacobhammerle@gmail.com</a>.</p>
